💘 Valentine React Game

A fun and interactive Valentine’s Day game built with React + TypeScript + Vite 💝
The goal is simple:

❌ Make it impossible to click NO
✅ Force the player to click YES 😏

Perfect for Valentine’s Day, pranks, or just making someone smile ❤️

🕹️ How It Works

❌ The NO button escapes randomly when you try to hover or click it

✅ The YES button grows bigger every time

💬 Cute messages always stay visible at the top

💖 Clicking YES fills the screen with floating hearts and love

Once you start… there’s no escape 😈💕

🚀 Live Demo

👉 Coming soon
(You can deploy this easily to Netlify or Vercel)

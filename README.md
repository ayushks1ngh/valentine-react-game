# 💘 Valentine React Game

A fun and interactive **Valentine’s Day game** built with **React + TypeScript + Vite** 💝  
The goal is simple:

> ❌ Make it *impossible* to click **NO**  
> ✅ Force the player to click **YES** 😏

Perfect for Valentine’s Day, pranks, or just making someone smile ❤️

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

- ❌ The **NO** button escapes randomly when you try to hover or click it  
- ✅ The **YES** button grows bigger every time  
- 💬 Cute messages always stay visible at the top  
- 💖 Clicking **YES** fills the screen with floating hearts and love  

Once you start… there’s no escape 😈💕

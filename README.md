# 💘 Valentine React Game

A fun and interactive **Valentine’s Day game** built with **React + TypeScript + Vite** 💝  

The goal is simple:
> ❌ Make it *impossible* to click **NO** > ✅ Force the player to click **YES** 😏

Perfect for Valentine’s Day, pranks, or just making someone smile ❤️

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

* ❌ The **NO** button escapes randomly when you try to hover or click it  
* ✅ The **YES** button grows bigger every time  
* 💬 Cute messages always stay visible at the top  
* 💖 Clicking **YES** fills the screen with floating hearts and love  

Once you start… there’s no escape 😈💕
